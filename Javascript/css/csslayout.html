        <h1>The Indus Valley Civilization</h1>
        <p>
            The Indus valley civilization was basically an urban civilization and the people lived in well-planned and
            well-built towns, which were also the centers for trade. The ruins of Mohenjodaro and Harappa show that
            these were magnificent merchant cities-well planned, scientifically laid, and well looked after. They had
            wide roads and a well-developed drainage system. The houses were made of baked bricks and had two or more
            storeys.
        </p>
        <h1>Vedic Civilization</h1>
        <p>
            The highly civilized Harappans knew the art of growing cereals, and wheat and barley constituted their
            staple food. They consumed vegetables and fruits and ate mutton, pork and eggs as well. Evidences also show
            that they wore cotton as well as woollen garments. By 1500 BC, the Harappan culture came to an end. Among
            various causes ascribed to the decay of Indus Valley Civilization are the recurrent floods and other natural
            causes like earthquake, etc.
